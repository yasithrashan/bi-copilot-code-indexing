main.bal:
```ballerina
// Configurable variables
configurable int servicePort = 8080;

// HTTP service for bookstore
service /bookstore on new http:Listener(servicePort) {
    // Service implementation...
}

// New service endpoint for statistics and management
service /admin on new http:Listener(servicePort) {
    // Service implementation...
}
```

The existing implementation shows two HTTP services (/bookstore and /admin) running on the same port (8080). To add a new HTTP server, you would need to:
1. Define a new service with a different port
2. Import ballerina/http (already present)
3. Configure the listener

Note: Both current services are using the same listener on port 8080.
