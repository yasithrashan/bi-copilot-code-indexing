**What the user query is asking for:**
The user wants to standardize error responses to return JSON objects with error messages instead of plain HTTP status codes. They want responses like `{ "error": "Book not found" }` instead of just HTTP status codes.

**Relevant sections from the project file that should help answer this:**
1. All HTTP endpoints that currently return plain status codes like `http:NOT_FOUND`, `http:BAD_REQUEST`, etc.
2. The `ErrorResponse` type in types.bal that defines the structure for error responses
3. Specific endpoints that need modification:
   - `resource function get books/[string bookId]()` - returns `http:NOT_FOUND`
   - `resource function post books()` - returns `http:BAD_REQUEST`  
   - `resource function put books/[string bookId]()` - returns `http:NOT_FOUND`, `http:BAD_REQUEST`
   - `resource function delete books/[string bookId]()` - returns `http:NOT_FOUND`
   - `resource function post categories()` - returns `http:BAD_REQUEST`

**What information is present in retrieved chunks:**
- Chunk 1: Shows `validateAndFormatBook` function that returns error strings
- Chunk 2: Shows POST books endpoint returning `http:BAD_REQUEST` (relevant but incomplete)
- Chunk 3: Shows error handling but just the validation call
- Chunks 4, 5, 6, 7, 8: Show various parts of the code but don't contain error response handling

**What should have been retrieved vs. what was retrieved:**
Should have retrieved: All HTTP endpoints with plain status code returns, the ErrorResponse type definition, specific error handling patterns
Actually retrieved: Only one endpoint with error handling (POST books), missing the ErrorResponse type, missing other endpoints with plain status codes

**Missing key information:**
- The `ErrorResponse` type definition from types.bal
- GET books/[bookId] endpoint that returns `http:NOT_FOUND`
- PUT books/[bookId] endpoint that returns `http:NOT_FOUND` and `http:BAD_REQUEST`
- DELETE books/[bookId] endpoint that returns `http:NOT_FOUND`
- POST categories endpoint that returns `http:BAD_REQUEST`

## Coverage Analysis
The retrieved chunks provide very limited coverage for the user query. Only one endpoint with error handling (POST books) is included, while multiple other endpoints that return plain HTTP status codes are missing. The crucial `ErrorResponse` type definition that would be needed for standardization is completely absent.

## Quality Assessment
Most retrieved chunks are not directly relevant to error response standardization. Chunk 2 shows one relevant example of plain status code usage, but chunks 1, 3-8 focus on other aspects like validation logic, pagination, and service structure rather than error response patterns. The retrieval missed the most important pieces needed to address the query.

## Gap Identification
Key missing information includes:
- `ErrorResponse` record type definition from types.bal
- GET books/[bookId] endpoint returning `http:NOT_FOUND`
- PUT books/[bookId] endpoint returning `http:NOT_FOUND` and `http:BAD_REQUEST`  
- DELETE books/[bookId] endpoint returning `http:NOT_FOUND`
- POST admin/categories endpoint returning `http:BAD_REQUEST`
- Complete pattern of current plain HTTP status code usage across the API

## Overall Feedback
The retrieval system should prioritize HTTP endpoint definitions and error response patterns when queries mention error standardization. It should also include type definitions that are directly relevant to the requested changes, such as the existing `ErrorResponse` type.

## Justification
The query specifically asks about standardizing error responses across HTTP endpoints, but the retrieval only captured one relevant endpoint and missed the error response type definition and other endpoints that need modification. This represents a significant gap in coverage for implementing the requested changes.
