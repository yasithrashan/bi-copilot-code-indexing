The user query asks to "Add a new HTTP server to the current implementation." This requires understanding:
1. The current HTTP server implementation structure
2. How to create new HTTP listeners/services
3. The existing service configurations and patterns

From the project file, the key information needed includes:
- Current HTTP service implementations: `service /bookstore on new http:Listener(servicePort)` and `service /admin on new http:Listener(servicePort)`
- HTTP listener configuration pattern: `new http:Listener(servicePort)`
- Service port configuration: `configurable int servicePort = 8080`
- HTTP import: `import ballerina/http`
- Service structure and resource function patterns

What's actually present in the retrieved chunks:
- Chunk 1: Shows the `/admin` service declaration
- Chunk 2: Shows the configurable service port
- Chunk 3: Shows the `/bookstore` service declaration  
- Chunk 4: Shows the HTTP import
- Chunks 5-6: Show resource function examples but not directly relevant to creating new servers
- Chunks 7-8: Show service name and request counter variables, less relevant

The chunks do capture the essential patterns for HTTP server creation (service declarations, listener configuration, imports) but miss some context about the overall service structure and complete resource function patterns that would help someone understand how to properly implement a new HTTP server.

## Coverage Analysis
The retrieved chunks cover the core elements needed to add a new HTTP server: the HTTP import, service port configuration, and examples of existing service declarations. However, the coverage is somewhat fragmented and lacks complete context about service structure and comprehensive resource function patterns.

## Quality Assessment
Chunks 1-4 are highly relevant, showing the exact patterns needed for HTTP server implementation. Chunks 5-6 provide some context about resource functions but are more focused on specific business logic rather than server structure. Chunks 7-8 are marginally relevant, showing configuration variables but not directly related to server creation.

## Gap Identification
- Missing complete service structure examples showing full resource function implementations
- Lack of context about how services share the same listener port
- Missing information about service naming conventions and path patterns
- No examples of different HTTP methods and response types that could guide new server implementation

## Overall Feedback
The retrieval captures the essential technical components but could benefit from including more complete service examples and better context about the overall architecture. The chunks are somewhat fragmented, making it harder to understand the full pattern for implementing a new HTTP server.

## Justification
While the core technical elements are present (HTTP import, listener configuration, service declarations), the fragmented nature and missing architectural context limit the completeness of the information needed to properly implement a new HTTP server.
