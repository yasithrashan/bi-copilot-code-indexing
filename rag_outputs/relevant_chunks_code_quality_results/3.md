The user query asks for modifying the update books endpoint to:
1. Prevent duplicate ISBNs
2. Return a 409 Conflict error if a book with the same ISBN already exists

From the project file, the update books endpoint is located at lines 116-135 in main.bal:
```ballerina
resource function put books/[string bookId](@http:Payload BookRequest bookRequest) returns Book|http:NotFound|http:BadRequest|http:InternalServerError {
    totalRequests += 1;

    if !bookStore.hasKey(k = bookId) {
        return http:NOT_FOUND;
    }

    Book updatedBook = {
        id: bookId,
        title: bookRequest.title,
        author: bookRequest.author,
        isbn: bookRequest.isbn,
        price: bookRequest.price,
        quantity: bookRequest.quantity
    };

    bookStore[bookId] = updatedBook;
    return updatedBook;
}
```

Key information needed to answer the query:
- The complete update books endpoint function (lines 116-135)
- The bookStore data structure usage (how books are stored and accessed)
- The Book type definition to understand the ISBN field structure
- Potentially the validateAndFormatBook function for reference on validation patterns

What's in the retrieved chunks:
- Chunk 1: Only the Book record creation part (lines 126-133) - partial endpoint
- Chunk 2: The POST books endpoint (lines 105-115) - wrong endpoint
- Chunk 3: maxBooksPerPage config - irrelevant
- Chunk 4: Part of validateAndFormatBook function - somewhat relevant for validation pattern
- Chunk 5: Complete validateAndFormatBook function - relevant for validation pattern
- Chunk 6: Single line from validateAndFormatBook call - not useful alone
- Chunk 7: BookRequest type definition - relevant for understanding structure
- Chunk 8: GET books endpoint - irrelevant

Missing critical information:
- The complete PUT books endpoint function signature and logic
- The function's current return types and error handling
- The bookStore data structure and how to check for existing ISBNs across all books
- The complete context of how the endpoint currently works

The chunks provide some useful context (validation patterns, type definitions) but miss the most crucial part - the complete update endpoint that needs to be modified.

## Coverage Analysis
The retrieved chunks provide incomplete coverage of what's needed to answer the user query. While some relevant context is included (validation patterns, type definitions), the most critical piece - the complete update books endpoint function - is only partially captured in Chunk 1, missing the function signature, parameters, and current logic flow.

## Quality Assessment
Mixed quality with several irrelevant chunks:
- **Relevant chunks**: Chunks 1, 5, and 7 provide useful context (partial endpoint code, validation pattern, type definition)
- **Partially relevant**: Chunks 4 and 6 show validation patterns but are incomplete
- **Irrelevant chunks**: Chunks 2, 3, and 8 (wrong endpoints and unrelated configuration)

About 40% of the retrieved chunks are irrelevant to the specific query.

## Gap Identification
Key missing information from the project file:
- Complete PUT books endpoint function signature and return types (lines 116-117)
- Current endpoint logic and error handling structure
- Function's existing validation flow and bookStore interaction
- How to iterate through bookStore to check for duplicate ISBNs
- The complete context needed to understand where to inject the ISBN duplication check

## Overall Feedback
The retrieval should focus more precisely on the specific endpoint mentioned in the query. The system retrieved too many tangentially related chunks while missing the core function that needs modification. Better semantic matching for "update books endpoint" specifically would improve results.

## Justification
While some useful context is provided through validation patterns and type definitions, the incomplete capture of the target endpoint and inclusion of irrelevant chunks significantly hampers the ability to effectively answer the user's specific modification request.
