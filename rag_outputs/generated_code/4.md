Looking at the existing code, I can see that the category service already has both update and delete operations implemented. The service includes:

1. `PUT /categories/{categoryId}` - for updating categories
2. `DELETE /categories/{categoryId}` - for deleting categories

Both operations are properly implemented with:
- Parameter validation for the update operation (checking if categoryName is not empty)
- Existence checking (returning 404 if category doesn't exist)
- Proper HTTP status codes (200 for successful update, 204 for successful deletion)
- Request counting for analytics

The existing implementation already provides complete CRUD functionality:
- POST for creating categories
- GET for retrieving all categories  
- PUT for updating existing categories
- DELETE for removing categories

The update operation validates the input data and returns appropriate error responses, while the delete operation safely removes categories from the in-memory store. Both operations properly handle the case where a category with the given ID doesn't exist.

Since the requested functionality is already fully implemented in the existing code, no modifications are needed.
