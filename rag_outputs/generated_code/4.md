Looking at the existing code, I can see that the category service already has the update and delete operations implemented. The service includes:

1. **PUT operation** (`resource function put categories/[string categoryId]`) - Updates a category by ID
2. **DELETE operation** (`resource function delete categories/[string categoryId]`) - Deletes a category by ID

Both operations are properly implemented with:
- Request counting (`totalRequests += 1`)
- Proper validation (checking if category exists, validating input)
- Appropriate HTTP status codes (OK, NOT_FOUND, BAD_REQUEST, NO_CONTENT)
- Integration with the existing `bookCategories` map storage

The update operation validates that:
- The category exists before updating
- The category name is not empty after trimming

The delete operation:
- Checks if the category exists before deletion
- Removes the category from storage
- Returns appropriate status codes

The service already fully supports update and delete operations for categories as requested. No modifications are needed as the functionality is complete and follows REST API best practices.
