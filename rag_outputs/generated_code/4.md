Looking at the existing code, I can see that the category service already has the update and delete operations implemented. The service includes:

1. `PUT /categories/{categoryId}` - Updates an existing category
2. `DELETE /categories/{categoryId}` - Deletes a category

The update operation validates that the category exists and that the new category name is not empty, then updates the category in the map. The delete operation checks if the category exists, removes it from the map, and returns appropriate HTTP status codes.

Both operations properly handle error cases:
- Return `404 Not Found` when the category doesn't exist
- Return `400 Bad Request` for invalid input (empty category name in update)
- Return appropriate success status codes (`200 OK` for update, `204 No Content` for delete)

The existing implementation already fulfills the requirements for extending the category service with update and delete operations. No modifications are needed as the functionality is already complete and properly implemented.
