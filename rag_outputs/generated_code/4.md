Looking at the existing code context, I can see that the category service already has update and delete operations implemented. The service includes:

1. `PUT /categories/{categoryId}` - for updating a specific category
2. `DELETE /categories/{categoryId}` - for deleting a specific category

Both operations are already properly implemented with appropriate validation and error handling:

- The PUT operation validates that the category exists and that the category name is not empty, then updates the category and returns the updated data
- The DELETE operation checks if the category exists, removes it from the map, and returns a 204 No Content response

The existing implementation already fully addresses the query requirements. The update operation allows modifying category details while preserving the categoryId, and the delete operation removes categories from the system. Both operations include proper HTTP status code responses for success and error scenarios.

Since the functionality is already complete and properly implemented, no modifications are needed to the existing code.
