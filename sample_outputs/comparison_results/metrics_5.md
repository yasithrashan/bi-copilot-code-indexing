# Multi-System RAG Comparison - Query 5

## Quality Metrics Table
| System | Overall Score | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|--------|---------------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Pinecone | 75 | 25.3% | 100% | 40.4% |
| FAISS | 45 | 11% | 75% | 19% |
| SQLite | 35 | 10% | 53% | 17% |
| Keyword Search | 65 | 50% | 80% | 62% |

## Performance Metrics Table
| System | Retrieval Time | Total Time | Chunks Retrieved |
|--------|----------------|-----------|------------------|
| Pinecone | 309.32 ms | 309.32 ms | 83 |
| FAISS | 8.83 ms | 8.83 ms | 83 |
| SQLite | 2.48 ms | 2.48 ms | 83 |
| Keyword Search | 0.81 ms | 0.81 ms | 24 |

## Rankings
- **Quality Winner**: Pinecone (75 points)
- **Speed Winner**: Keyword Search (0.81 ms)
- **Precision Leader**: Keyword Search (50%)
- **Recall Leader**: Pinecone (100%)
- **Most Efficient**: Keyword Search (65 points / 0.81 ms = 80.2 quality per ms)

## Key Insights
- **Perfect Recall vs Speed Trade-off**: Pinecone achieved 100% recall but at 380x slower speed than keyword search, highlighting the classic quality-speed trade-off in RAG systems.

- **Precision Problems Across Vector Systems**: All three vector-based systems (Pinecone, FAISS, SQLite) suffered from extremely low precision (10-25%), retrieving too many irrelevant chunks like email configuration and variable assignments instead of focusing on architectural patterns needed for GraphQL implementation.

- **Keyword Search Shows Promise**: Despite being the simplest approach, keyword search achieved the best precision (50%) and reasonable recall (80%), demonstrating that for architectural queries, term matching can be more effective than semantic similarity.

- **Architectural Query Challenges**: This GraphQL implementation query revealed a key weakness in vector embeddings - they struggle to distinguish between different types of operations (email vs API operations) when the business domain is similar, leading to noise in results.

- **Retrieval Volume Impact**: Vector systems retrieved 83 chunks vs keyword search's 24, but the additional chunks were mostly irrelevant, suggesting that smaller, more targeted retrievals may be preferable for implementation-focused queries.

- **Speed Hierarchy**: Clear performance tiers emerged - keyword search (0.81ms) >> SQLite (2.48ms) >> FAISS (8.83ms) >> Pinecone (309.32ms), with 380x difference between fastest and slowest.
