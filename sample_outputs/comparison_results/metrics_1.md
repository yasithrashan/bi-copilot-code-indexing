# Multi-System RAG Comparison - Query 1

## Quality Metrics Table
| System | Overall Score | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|--------|---------------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Pinecone | 35 | 6.7% | 71.4% | 12.2% |
| FAISS | 75 | 12% | 100% | 21% |
| SQLite | 35 | 8% | 100% | 15% |
| Keyword Search | 55 | 32% | 78% | 45% |

## Performance Metrics Table
| System | Retrieval Time | Total Time | Chunks Retrieved |
|--------|----------------|-----------|------------------|
| Pinecone | 1017.93 ms | 1017.94 ms | 75 |
| FAISS | 8.48 ms | 8.48 ms | 75 |
| SQLite | 3.75 ms | 3.75 ms | 75 |
| Keyword Search | 1.46 ms | 1.46 ms | 22 |

## Rankings
- **Quality Winner**: FAISS (75 points)
- **Speed Winner**: Keyword Search (1.46 ms)
- **Precision Leader**: Keyword Search (32%)
- **Recall Leader**: FAISS & SQLite (100%)
- **Most Efficient**: FAISS (best quality-to-speed ratio at 75/8.48)

## Key Insights
- **Vector vs Keyword Trade-offs**: Vector systems (FAISS, SQLite, Pinecone) achieved perfect or near-perfect recall by capturing all existing notification code, while keyword search had higher precision but missed configuration components.

- **Performance Spectrum**: Massive speed differences exist - keyword search was ~700x faster than Pinecone, while FAISS and SQLite offered good compromises at ~6x and ~3x faster than Pinecone respectively.

- **Quality Issues**: All systems struggled with precision due to retrieving too many irrelevant chunks. The query required understanding architectural patterns for pluggable design, but systems focused on email-specific implementation details.

- **Vector System Differences**: Despite using similar embeddings, vector systems showed significant quality variations (FAISS 75 vs Pinecone/SQLite 35), suggesting implementation and similarity scoring differences matter substantially.

- **Missing Context Problem**: Most systems missed crucial configuration code (Gmail client setup, type definitions) needed for implementing the pluggable notification design, indicating keyword strategies might complement vector approaches.

- **Scalability Implications**: Pinecone's slow performance (1+ second) would be problematic for real-time applications, while local vector solutions (FAISS, SQLite) offer much better latency with comparable or better quality.
