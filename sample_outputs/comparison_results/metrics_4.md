## Rankings
- **Quality Winner**: Pinecone & FAISS (tied at 75)
- **Speed Winner**: Keyword Search (0.87 ms)
- **Precision Leader**: Pinecone (23%)
- **Recall Leader**: Pinecone & FAISS (tied at 100%)
- **Most Efficient**: FAISS (75 quality score at 9.67 ms)

## Key Insights

- **Perfect Recall Challenge**: Both Pinecone and FAISS achieved perfect recall (100%) for Redis caching implementation, successfully identifying all database functions needing cache integration (getAllFeedback, getFeedbackById, getFeedbackStats, insertFeedback), but suffered from poor precision due to retrieving many irrelevant chunks (email functions, variable assignments, configuration strings).

- **Speed vs Quality Trade-off**: There's a clear inverse relationship between retrieval speed and quality. The fastest system (Keyword Search at 0.87 ms) delivered the lowest quality (35 score), while the highest quality systems (Pinecone/FAISS at 75 score) were significantly slower (309.6 ms vs 9.67 ms respectively).

- **Vector Search Superiority**: Vector-based systems (Pinecone, FAISS, SQLite) significantly outperformed keyword search for this complex caching implementation task, understanding semantic relationships between database operations and caching requirements that keyword matching couldn't capture.

- **Precision Problems Across All Systems**: All systems struggled with precision (15-23%), indicating that the query complexity around Redis caching, cache invalidation, and cache-aside patterns resulted in many false positives. The systems retrieved relevant database functions but also pulled in substantial noise.

- **FAISS Optimal Balance**: FAISS emerged as the most efficient option, matching Pinecone's quality (75 score, 100% recall) while being 32x faster (9.67 ms vs 309.6 ms), making it ideal for production Redis caching implementation scenarios.

- **Missing Critical Context**: All systems missed important configuration patterns and initialization contexts that would be crucial for implementing a complete Redis caching solution, suggesting the need for query refinement or hybrid approaches for complex architectural changes.
