## Quality Metrics Table
| System | Overall Score | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|--------|---------------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Pinecone | 75 | 22% | 100% | 36% |
| FAISS | 75 | 58% | 100% | 73% |
| SQLite | 45 | 16% | 100% | 28% |
| Keyword Search | 75 | 22% | 100% | 36% |

## Performance Metrics Table
| System | Retrieval Time | Total Time | Chunks Retrieved |
|--------|----------------|-----------|------------------|
| Pinecone | 411.85ms | 411.85ms | 55 |
| FAISS | 9.4ms | 9.4ms | 55 |
| SQLite | 2.94ms | 2.94ms | 55 |
| Keyword Search | 0.81ms | 0.81ms | 51 |

## Rankings
- Quality Winner: **FAISS** (75 overall score with 58% precision)
- Speed Winner: **Keyword Search** (0.81ms)
- Precision Leader: **FAISS** (58%)
- Recall Leader: **Tie - All systems** (100%)
- Most Efficient: **FAISS** (Best quality-to-speed ratio: 75 score at 9.4ms)

## Key Insights
- **Perfect Recall Across Systems**: All systems successfully retrieved 100% of relevant existing code (current stats function, database schema, data structures), indicating effective keyword/semantic matching for core functionality.

- **Dramatic Precision Differences**: FAISS achieved 58% precision vs 16-22% for other systems, retrieving significantly fewer irrelevant chunks (23 vs 42-46 false positives).

- **Speed vs Quality Trade-off**: Keyword Search was fastest (0.81ms) but had lowest overall score (tied). FAISS provided best balance with 43x faster retrieval than Pinecone while maintaining equal overall quality.

- **Vector Database Performance Gap**: Pinecone's 411ms retrieval time was 140x slower than SQLite's 2.94ms, suggesting potential network latency or indexing inefficiencies for this query type.

- **Task-Specific Strengths**: For upgrading existing functionality, all systems captured essential baseline code (getFeedbackStats function, database schema, HTTP endpoints), but differed significantly in noise filtering - critical for LLM efficiency in code generation tasks.

- **Chunk Volume Consistency**: Most systems retrieved 55 chunks (except Keyword Search with 51), but FAISS's superior precision meant developers would need to filter through far fewer irrelevant code fragments.
