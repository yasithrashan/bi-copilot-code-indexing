## Performance Metrics Table
| System | Retrieval Time | Total Time | Chunks Retrieved |
|--------|----------------|-----------|------------------|
| Pinecone | 542.85ms | 542.85ms | 70 |
| FAISS | 8.15ms | 8.15ms | 70 |

| Keyword Search | 1.19ms | 1.19ms | 19 |

## Rankings
- **Quality Winner**: Tie between Pinecone and FAISS (75)
- **Speed Winner**: SQLite (0.88ms)
- **Precision Leader**: Keyword Search (21%)
- **Recall Leader**: Tie between Pinecone and FAISS (100%)
- **Most Efficient**: SQLite (best quality-to-speed ratio considering the score vs time)

## Key Insights

- **Perfect Recall Challenge**: Pinecone and FAISS both achieved 100% recall by retrieving all relevant validation code, but suffered from extremely low precision (8.6-11.4%) due to retrieving 70 chunks with many irrelevant email services and database operations.

- **Speed vs Quality Trade-off**: SQLite was 616x faster than Pinecone while maintaining reasonable quality (45 vs 75), making it highly efficient despite lower overall scores.

- **Precision-Recall Balance**: Keyword Search achieved the best precision (21%) but lower recall (67%), missing important type definitions. This represents a different trade-off approach - fewer but more targeted results.

- **Semantic vs Keyword Limitations**: All semantic systems (Pinecone, FAISS, SQLite) struggled with the same precision problem, retrieving similar irrelevant chunks. The validation query's broad semantic similarity to email/HTTP handling code caused noise across all vector-based approaches.

- **Missing Critical Context**: All systems missed important type definitions (ErrorResponse, CustomerFeedback types) that would be essential for implementing a complete validation framework, indicating gaps in retrieval strategy for architectural queries.

- **Consistency Across Vector Systems**: The similar performance between Pinecone, FAISS, and SQLite (all retrieving 70 chunks with similar precision issues) suggests the embedding model's limitations rather than differences in vector database implementation.
