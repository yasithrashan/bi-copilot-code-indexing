# RAG System Comparison: Doc 5
**Date:** 2025-01-27
**Query:** "Add GraphQL support next to REST APIs. Include queries with filters, mutations for submissions, and subscriptions for live updates. Use DataLoader to avoid N+1 queries and limit query complexity."

## Executive Summary
Pinecone emerges as the clear winner for this GraphQL implementation query, achieving 72/100 overall quality despite slower retrieval times. While all systems struggled with precision (13-15.7%), Pinecone's superior recall (81.3%) captured more critical database functions and REST endpoints needed for GraphQL adaptation. FAISS and SQLite performed poorly due to overwhelming noise from irrelevant email and configuration code.

## Comparative Metrics

| Metric | Pinecone | FAISS | SQLite | Winner | Margin |
|--------|----------|-------|--------|--------|---------|
| Overall Score | 72/100 | 25/100 | 35/100 | Pinecone | +37 pts |
| Precision | 15.7% | 13% | 13.3% | Pinecone | +2.4% |
| Recall | 81.3% | 100% | 78.6% | FAISS | +18.7% |
| F1-Score | 26.1% | 23% | 22.8% | Pinecone | +3.1% |
| Retrieval Time | 621.45ms | 8.26ms | 1.85ms | SQLite | 335x faster |
| Total Time | 621.45ms | 8.26ms | 1.85ms | SQLite | 335x faster |
| Relevant Chunks | 13/83 | 11/83 | 11/83 | Pinecone | +2 chunks |

## Quality Analysis

**Retrieval Accuracy:** All systems suffered from poor precision (13-16%), retrieving large amounts of irrelevant email service and configuration code. Pinecone achieved the best balance with 81.3% recall, capturing most essential database operations, while FAISS's 100% recall included no additional useful content over Pinecone.

**Chunk Quality:** Top similarity scores were nearly identical (0.566-0.5658), but Pinecone's ranking algorithm better prioritized structural code patterns like service definitions and data types over granular variable assignments that dominated other systems.

**Missing Information:**
- Pinecone: Missing CustomerFeedback type definition, database client initialization, and validation functions (3 critical gaps)
- FAISS: No missing information identified - all relevant existing code retrieved
- SQLite: Missing complete database configuration, CustomerFeedback type, and initialization function (3 critical gaps)

## Performance Analysis

**Speed Comparison:** SQLite dominates with 1.85ms retrieval time, 335x faster than Pinecone's 621.45ms. FAISS provides middle ground at 8.26ms, still 75x faster than Pinecone.

**Efficiency:** SQLite delivers 5.9 relevant chunks per second, FAISS 1.3/sec, Pinecone only 0.02/sec - highlighting Pinecone's severe speed penalty.

**Trade-offs:** Clear speed vs accuracy trade-off. Pinecone's 2.9x better overall quality comes at 335x slower retrieval time, making it impractical for real-time applications.

## System Characteristics

**Pinecone:**
- Strengths: Best overall retrieval quality, superior recall for complex queries, better ranking of structural code patterns
- Weaknesses: Extremely slow retrieval (621ms), still poor precision with much noise
- Best for: Offline code analysis where accuracy matters more than speed

**FAISS:**
- Strengths: Fast retrieval (8.26ms), perfect recall of existing relevant code, good balance of speed and coverage
- Weaknesses: Poor precision (13%), no better content quality than slower alternatives
- Best for: Development environments where speed is important but some noise is acceptable

**SQLite:**
- Strengths: Fastest retrieval (1.85ms), decent chunk relevance scores, good for rapid iteration
- Weaknesses: Lowest overall quality (35/100), missed critical type definitions, poor discrimination
- Best for: Real-time applications where sub-second response times are critical

## Verdict

**Overall Winner:** Pinecone (72/100 quality score)

**Quality Winner:** Pinecone (72/100)

**Speed Winner:** SQLite (1.85ms - 335x faster than Pinecone)

**Best Value:** FAISS (balances 8.26ms speed with decent coverage)

**Key Insights:**
- All systems struggle with precision on complex technical queries, retrieving 85-87% irrelevant chunks
- Speed differences are dramatic (335x) but quality improvements are modest (2.9x) for this query type
- Missing critical type definitions significantly impact all systems' ability to support GraphQL schema generation

**Recommendation:** Choose SQLite for real-time development assistance where rapid feedback is essential, or Pinecone for thorough offline code analysis where completeness matters more than response time. FAISS offers a reasonable middle ground for most development workflows.
