# RAG System Comparison: Doc 1
**Date:** 2025-10-13
**Query:** "Add support for multiple notification channels like SMS (Twilio) and Slack. Use a pluggable design to choose channels for customer and admin alerts, and add retry and fallback when one fails."

## Executive Summary
FAISS emerges as the clear winner with perfect recall and the highest overall score, successfully capturing all existing notification patterns needed for the pluggable design implementation. While all systems suffer from poor precision due to retrieving many irrelevant code fragments, FAISS provides the most complete foundation for understanding the current notification architecture. SQLite offers the best speed-to-quality ratio, making it suitable for time-sensitive scenarios where good-enough results are acceptable.

## Comparative Metrics

| Metric | Pinecone | FAISS | SQLite | Winner | Margin |
|--------|----------|-------|--------|--------|---------|
| Overall Score | 45/100 | 75/100 | 65/100 | FAISS | 30 pts |
| Precision | 8% | 9% | 8% | FAISS | 1% |
| Recall | 75% | 100% | 100% | FAISS/SQLite | Tie |
| F1-Score | 14.3% | 17% | 15% | FAISS | 2% |
| Retrieval Time | 1021.61ms | 8.75ms | 4.28ms | SQLite | 116x faster |
| Total Time | 1021.62ms | 8.76ms | 4.28ms | SQLite | 239x faster |
| Relevant Chunks | 6/75 | 7/75 | 6/75 | FAISS | +1 chunk |

## Quality Analysis

**Retrieval Accuracy:** All systems struggle with precision (8-9%), indicating similar chunking strategies that fragment code too granularly. FAISS achieves perfect recall by capturing all existing notification functions, while Pinecone misses critical Gmail configuration setup code.

**Chunk Quality:** Top relevance scores are nearly identical (0.6098-0.6103), showing consistent semantic understanding. However, the long tail of irrelevant chunks (scores 0.40-0.50) creates significant noise across all systems.

**Missing Information:**
- Pinecone: Missing Gmail client initialization and complete configuration variables from config.bal (lines 4-20)
- FAISS: None - all relevant existing code captured
- SQLite: None - all relevant existing code captured

## Performance Analysis

**Speed Comparison:** SQLite dominates with 4.28ms retrieval, followed by FAISS (8.75ms) and Pinecone (1021.61ms). Pinecone's cloud-based architecture introduces 100x+ latency overhead.

**Efficiency:** SQLite delivers 1.4 relevant chunks per millisecond, FAISS provides 0.8, while Pinecone manages only 0.006 relevant chunks per millisecond.

**Trade-offs:** Local systems (FAISS/SQLite) offer 100x+ speed advantages with comparable or better accuracy than cloud-based Pinecone.

## System Characteristics

**Pinecone:**
- Strengths: Managed service with auto-scaling, good semantic understanding
- Weaknesses: High latency, missing critical configuration code, lowest overall score
- Best for: Production systems where infrastructure management overhead outweighs performance requirements

**FAISS:**
- Strengths: Perfect recall, highest precision, fastest relevant chunk identification, complete code coverage
- Weaknesses: Requires local infrastructure, still suffers from low precision due to chunking strategy
- Best for: Development environments requiring comprehensive code understanding

**SQLite:**
- Strengths: Fastest retrieval, simple deployment, good recall, balanced speed-quality ratio
- Weaknesses: Slightly lower precision than FAISS, text-based similarity limitations
- Best for: Rapid prototyping and time-sensitive code analysis scenarios

## Verdict

**Overall Winner:** FAISS

**Quality Winner:** FAISS (75/100)

**Speed Winner:** SQLite (4.28ms)

**Best Value:** SQLite - delivers 87% of FAISS quality at 2x speed

**Key Insights:**
- All systems suffer from over-fragmented chunking, retrieving 69+ irrelevant code snippets
- Perfect recall is achievable (FAISS/SQLite) but comes with significant precision penalties
- Local systems provide 100-240x speed improvements over cloud-based solutions with better accuracy

**Recommendation:** Use FAISS for comprehensive notification system refactoring where complete code understanding is critical. Choose SQLite for rapid development cycles where good-enough results and speed matter more than perfect completeness. Avoid Pinecone for code retrieval tasks due to high latency and incomplete results.
