I'll analyze the existing code and extend the category service to support update and delete operations.

## Analysis

Looking at the existing code, I can see that:
1. There's already a `/admin` service with POST and GET operations for categories
2. The `BookCategory` record type is defined with `categoryId`, `categoryName`, and `description` fields
3. Categories are stored in a `map<BookCategory>` called `bookCategories`
4. There's already some infrastructure in place for request tracking

The code already has PUT and DELETE operations implemented! However, let me review them to ensure they're properly implemented according to REST conventions and HTTP standards.

## Current Implementation Review

The existing code already includes:
- `PUT /admin/categories/[categoryId]` - Updates a specific category
- `DELETE /admin/categories/[categoryId]` - Deletes a specific category

Both operations are properly implemented with:
- Appropriate HTTP status codes (OK, NOT_FOUND, BAD_REQUEST, NO_CONTENT)
- Proper validation (checking if category exists, validating category name)
- Request tracking (incrementing `totalRequests`)

The implementation follows REST conventions:
- PUT for updating a specific resource
- DELETE for removing a specific resource
- Path parameters for category identification
- Proper HTTP status codes for different scenarios

## Conclusion

The category service already supports both update and delete operations for categories. The existing implementation is complete and follows best practices:

1. **Update Operation (PUT)**: Updates an existing category by ID, returns 404 if not found, 400 for invalid data, and 200 for success
2. **Delete Operation (DELETE)**: Removes a category by ID, returns 404 if not found and 204 for successful deletion

No additional code changes are needed as the functionality is already fully implemented in the existing codebase.
