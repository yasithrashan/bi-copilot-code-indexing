## User Query
Modify the update books endpoint to prevent duplicate ISBNs and return a 409 Conflict error if a book with the same ISBN already exists.

## Chunk Relevance
Chunk 1: ✓ Relevant
Contains validation logic for books that can be adapted for ISBN check.

Chunk 2: ✗ Not Relevant
Relates to creating new books, not updating existing ones.

Chunk 3: ✗ Not Relevant
Contains search functionality, not relevant to updating books.

Chunk 4: ✗ Not Relevant
Single line about book validation, not specific to updating.

Chunk 5: ✗ Not Relevant
Retrieves books, not related to updating or ISBN checks.

## Missing Information
- The current update books endpoint code
- Logic for checking existing ISBNs in the bookstore
- HTTP 409 Conflict error response handling

## Score: 30

The retrieved chunks are mostly irrelevant to the specific task of modifying the update books endpoint. While Chunk 1 provides some useful validation logic, the crucial information about the existing update endpoint and ISBN checking is missing, making it difficult for an LLM to generate accurate and complete code for the required modification.
