## Missing Information

- Code for delete operation for categories
- BookCategory type definition

## Score: 65

The retrieval provides some context for the existing category service but lacks crucial information for implementing update and delete operations. The missing BookCategory type definition and absence of similar CRUD operations limit the LLM's ability to generate accurate and complete code for the requested functionality.
