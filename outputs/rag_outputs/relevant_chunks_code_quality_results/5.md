## User Query
Standardize the error responses so they always return a JSON object with an error message (e.g., { "error": "Book not found" }) instead of just plain HTTP status codes.

## Chunk Relevance
Chunk 1: ✗ Not Relevant - Shows validation logic but doesn't contain error response handling that needs standardization.
Chunk 2: ✓ Relevant - Contains POST endpoint that returns http:BAD_REQUEST status code that needs JSON error response.
Chunk 3: ✗ Not Relevant - Single line of validation code without error response context.
Chunk 4: ✗ Not Relevant - GET books endpoint only returns success responses and http:InternalServerError.
Chunk 5: ✗ Not Relevant - Search endpoint only returns success responses and http:InternalServerError.
Chunk 6: ✗ Not Relevant - Service declaration line with no error handling context.
Chunk 7: ✗ Not Relevant - Variable declaration with no error handling context.
Chunk 8: ✗ Not Relevant - Configuration variable with no error handling context.

## Missing Information
Missing critical resource functions that return plain HTTP status codes: GET books/[id] (returns http:NOT_FOUND), PUT books/[id] (returns http:NOT_FOUND, http:BAD_REQUEST), DELETE books/[id] (returns http:NOT_FOUND), and admin endpoints. Also missing the ErrorResponse type definition from types.bal that would be needed for standardization.
