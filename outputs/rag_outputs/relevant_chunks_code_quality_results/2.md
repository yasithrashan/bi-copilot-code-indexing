## Chunk Relevance

Chunk 3: ✓ Relevant - Contains the complete validateAndFormatBook function with all validation logic needed.
Chunk 4: ✓ Relevant - Shows the current PUT endpoint's book creation without validation.
Chunk 5: ✓ Relevant - Shows complete POST endpoint implementation using validateAndFormatBook for reference.
Chunk 6: ✗ Not Relevant - Simple book retrieval line not related to PUT endpoint modification.
Chunk 7: ✗ Not Relevant - Search functionality unrelated to PUT endpoint validation.
Chunk 8: ✓ Relevant - BookRequest type definition needed to understand the validation function parameters.

## Missing Information
The complete PUT endpoint function signature and structure is partially missing - only the book creation part is retrieved, not the full endpoint implementation with proper error handling patterns.
