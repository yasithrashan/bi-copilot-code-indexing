## User Query
Extend the category service to also support update and delete operations for categories.

## Chunk Relevance
Chunk 1: ✓ Relevant - Shows the existing POST categories endpoint that needs to be extended with update/delete operations.

Chunk 2: ✓ Relevant - Shows the existing GET categories endpoint, providing context for the current category service structure.

Chunk 3: ✓ Relevant - Shows the bookCategories storage map that will be used by the new update/delete operations.

Chunk 4: ✓ Relevant - Shows the BookCategory type definition needed for implementing update/delete operations.

Chunk 5: ✗ Not Relevant - Service name configuration is not needed for implementing category CRUD operations.

Chunk 6: ✗ Not Relevant - Service port configuration is not needed for implementing category CRUD operations.

Chunk 7: ✗ Not Relevant - The /bookstore service declaration is not relevant for extending the /admin category service.

Chunk 8: ✗ Not Relevant - Book update logic is not directly relevant for category operations, though it could serve as a pattern reference.

## Missing Information
The admin service declaration (service /admin) where the category endpoints are defined is missing, which is crucial context for adding new endpoints to the correct service.

## Score: 72

The retrieval captures the essential existing category endpoints and data structures, but lacks the admin service context and includes some irrelevant chunks. The LLM can still generate the required update/delete operations based on the existing patterns shown.
