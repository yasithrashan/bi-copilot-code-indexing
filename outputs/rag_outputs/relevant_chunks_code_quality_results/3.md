## User Query
Modify the update books endpoint to prevent duplicate ISBNs and return a 409 Conflict error if a book with the same ISBN already exists.

## Chunk Relevance
Chunk 1: ✓ Relevant - Contains the Book object creation logic within the update endpoint that needs modification.

Chunk 2: ✓ Relevant - Shows the POST books endpoint structure and validation pattern that can guide the update endpoint modification.

Chunk 3: ✗ Not Relevant - Configurable variable for pagination has no relation to ISBN duplication checking.

Chunk 4: ✓ Relevant - Shows Book object structure and ISBN field handling in validation context.

Chunk 5: ✓ Relevant - Contains the validation function that could be extended or referenced for ISBN duplication logic.

Chunk 6: ✗ Not Relevant - Single line of validation call without sufficient context for the modification needed.

Chunk 7: ✓ Relevant - Defines BookRequest type structure including ISBN field that's central to the duplication check.

Chunk 8: ✗ Not Relevant - GET books endpoint with pagination logic unrelated to update functionality or ISBN validation.

## Missing Information
The complete update books endpoint function (resource function put books/[string bookId]) is missing - only a fragment showing the Book object creation is retrieved. The bookStore map structure and methods for checking existing ISBNs are not included.

## Score: 45

The retrieval provides some relevant pieces but lacks the complete update endpoint code and the bookStore access patterns needed to implement ISBN duplication checking effectively.
