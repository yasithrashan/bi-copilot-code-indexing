## User Query
Standardize the error responses so they always return a JSON object with an error message (e.g., { "error": "Book not found" }) instead of just plain HTTP status codes.

## Chunk Relevance
Chunk 1: ✓ Relevant - Contains validation function that returns error messages, relevant for understanding current error handling.
Chunk 2: ✓ Relevant - Shows POST endpoint returning plain HTTP status codes that need to be standardized.
Chunk 3: ✗ Not Relevant - Single line of code without context, redundant with Chunk 1.
Chunk 4: ✗ Not Relevant - GET books endpoint that doesn't show error response patterns.
Chunk 5: ✗ Not Relevant - Search endpoint that doesn't demonstrate error handling patterns.
Chunk 6: ✗ Not Relevant - Service declaration without error handling context.
Chunk 7: ✗ Not Relevant - Variable declaration without error handling relevance.
Chunk 8: ✗ Not Relevant - Configuration variable unrelated to error responses.

## Missing Information
Missing critical endpoints that return plain HTTP status codes: GET books/[id], PUT books/[id], DELETE books/[id], and POST categories endpoints. Also missing the ErrorResponse type definition from types.bal which would be needed for standardization.

## Score: 35

The retrieval captures some relevant error handling patterns but misses most of the endpoints that actually need to be modified to return JSON error responses instead of plain HTTP status codes.
