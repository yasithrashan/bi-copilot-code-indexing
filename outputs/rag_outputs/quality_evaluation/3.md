## User Query
Modify the update books endpoint to prevent duplicate ISBNs and return a 409 Conflict error if a book with the same ISBN already exists.

## Chunk Relevance
Chunk 1: ✓ Relevant - Shows the current update book implementation that needs modification.
Chunk 2: ✓ Relevant - Shows the POST books endpoint which may have similar ISBN validation logic to reference.
Chunk 3: ✗ Not Relevant - Configuration variable for pagination is unrelated to ISBN validation.
Chunk 4: ✓ Relevant - Shows book creation structure that includes ISBN field.
Chunk 5: ✓ Relevant - Shows the validateAndFormatBook function that could be extended for ISBN duplicate checking.
Chunk 6: ✗ Not Relevant - Single line reference to validation function without context.
Chunk 7: ✓ Relevant - Shows BookRequest type structure including ISBN field.
Chunk 8: ✗ Not Relevant - GET books endpoint is unrelated to update functionality.

## Missing Information
The complete PUT books endpoint implementation is missing - only showing the book creation part but not the full resource function signature and error handling structure. Also missing the bookStore data structure access patterns needed for ISBN duplicate checking.
