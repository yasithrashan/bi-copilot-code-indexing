Chunk 2: ✓ Relevant - Shows existing GET categories endpoint, providing context for the category service structure.
Chunk 3: ✓ Relevant - Shows the bookCategories storage map that will be used for update/delete operations.
Chunk 4: ✓ Relevant - Shows the BookCategory type definition needed for understanding the data structure.
Chunk 5: ✗ Not Relevant - Service name configuration is not needed for implementing CRUD operations.
Chunk 6: ✗ Not Relevant - Service port configuration is not needed for implementing CRUD operations.
Chunk 7: ✗ Not Relevant - Bookstore service declaration is not relevant to category service extension.

## Missing Information
Examples of similar update/delete operations from the books service (PUT and DELETE endpoints) that could serve as implementation patterns for categories.

## Score: 75

The retrieval provides the essential components (existing category endpoints, storage mechanism, and type definitions) but lacks implementation patterns from similar operations in the codebase that would help guide the extension.
