## Chunk Relevance
Chunk 1: ✓ Relevant - Shows existing admin service structure on HTTP listener for reference.
Chunk 2: ✓ Relevant - Shows the configurable port variable that would be needed for a new server.
Chunk 3: ✓ Relevant - Shows existing bookstore service structure as a template for creating new servers.
Chunk 4: ✓ Relevant - Shows the required HTTP import statement needed for HTTP server functionality.
Chunk 5: ✗ Not Relevant - Specific resource function implementation not needed for adding a new server.
Chunk 6: ✗ Not Relevant - Specific resource function implementation not needed for adding a new server.
Chunk 7: ✗ Not Relevant - Service name configuration not directly relevant to creating new HTTP servers.
Chunk 8: ✗ Not Relevant - Module variable not directly relevant to HTTP server creation.

## Missing Information
The chunks show existing service structures but lack examples of creating HTTP listeners with different ports or configurations, which would be helpful for implementing a truly separate HTTP server.
